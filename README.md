# FINAL-YEAR-PROJECT-CODES
Code Submission for FYP 

In ,Main3in1codes.ipynb , it has the following purpose : 
1)The primary notebook.
2)Integrates AdaIN (TFHub), VGG Optimizer, and MobileNet Optimizer into a unified Gradio interface.
3)Produces both stylised outputs and evaluation metrics (SSIM, LPIPS).
4)Demonstrates the final 3-in-1 prototype.

In , VGG19.ipynb, it has the following purpose : 
1)Scratch-built pipeline for VGG19-based optimisation.
2)Used to test content/style loss balance, structural preservation, and to generate a portfolio of stylised results.

In ,MobileNet.ipynb , it has the following purpose : 
1)Scratch-built pipeline for MobileNetV2-based optimisation.
2)Focused on efficiency trade-offs and multi-stage optimisation at different resolutions.

In ,ADAINdraftwithfg.ipynb , it has the following purpose :
1)Prototype for AdaIN (using TFHub pretrained model).
2)Includes testing of extra features such as foreground masking.

Kindly note that all notebooks were developed and run on Google Colab, ensuring reproducibility with GPU support.
